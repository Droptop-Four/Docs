## What is a Community Theme?

Standard themes are fine, if you [buy the supporter version](https://gumroad.droptopfour.com) you still have more options to choose from, but no theme is yours like the one you create yourself.

A Community Theme is a theme created by Droptop users to have a better experience of Droptop. Those themes can also be compiled and shared between Droptop users, and published on the [Droptop Four website](https://droptopfour.com/community-themes).
