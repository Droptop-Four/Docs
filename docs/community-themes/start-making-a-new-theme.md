In the Theme Builder you can:

1. Use the provided dropdown menu to navigate between editing various different categories of your theme (eg. color, font, size, shape, spacing, etc.)&#x20;
2. Use the side bar to choose from a list of available options for that category.
3. Use the slider to adjust the option.

Take your time, jump around on all the options and configure the theme how you like it!
