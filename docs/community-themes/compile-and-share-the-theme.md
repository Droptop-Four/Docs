# üèÅ Compile & Share the Theme

When you finished setting up your theme, you have to click `Save & share`.

The process will now be different if you have to create a new theme or you have to update an existing one:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Create new theme" %}
If you are creating a new theme, click on the `New theme` button, choose the name of the theme and insert the name of the creator (you). Then put an image of the theme to show other users how the final result will be after installing your theme.\
Then click on the `Generate theme` button and wait for the compiling to end.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Update existing theme" %}
If you want to update an existing theme, click on the `Update theme` button.\
You won't be able to change the theme name or the author name, but you can change the image of the theme. If you want to use the same image that you choosed previously, tick the box `Re-use existing image`.\
Then click on the `Generate theme` button and wait for the compiling to end.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

When finished, an .rmskin file will be generated. Go to the [Droptop Discord](https://discord.gg/droptop-four-800124057923485728) server and type the command `/community_theme new_release` in any chat box. Drag & drop the .rmskin file to the box that appears in the chat, or click the box to select a `.rmskin` file from Windows Explorer. Press enter to submit.

Your app will then be uploaded to our Github, posted to the [Droptop website](https://droptopfour.com/community-themes), and a new thread for your app will be created in the [#üÜï‚ïètheme-releases](https://discord.gg/droptop-four-800124057923485728) channel on Discord.
