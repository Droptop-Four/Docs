1. Use the provided dropdown menu to navigate between editing various different categories of your theme (eg. Color, font, size, shape, spacing, etc.)&#x20;
2. Use the side bar to choose from a list of available options for that category.
3. Use the slider to adjust the option.
4. When finished, use the `Save & share`option to compile your theme into an installable file for others to use, or to create a backup of your theme.

## Sharing your theme

Head over to the Droptop Discord server and type the command `/community_theme new_release`. Drag & drop the Rmskin you generated using the `Save & share` option into the first box, and provide a screenshot of your theme using the second box. Press enter when finished.

Your theme will automatically be posted to the [Droptopfour.com](https://www.droptopfour.com) website, the [Droptop Store](https://www.droptopfour.com/community-apps), and be posted to the [#theme-releases](https://discord.com/channels/800124057923485728/1041735291968434296) channel on Discord.
