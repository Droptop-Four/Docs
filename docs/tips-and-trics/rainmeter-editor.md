# ‚úç Rainmeter editor

It's recommended you install an **advanced editor** instead of using the Windows Notepad to work on your Rainmeter projects and files, since they usually offers a lot of useful functions, like **syntax highlighting** or **errors recognition**.

The two editors we recommend are:

[#notepad++](rainmeter-editor.md#notepad++ "mention")

[#visual-studio-code](rainmeter-editor.md#visual-studio-code "mention")



## Notepad++

You can download **Notepad++** from its official website here: [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). Set **Notepad++** as your official editor for Rainmeter by following these steps:&#x20;
