## Create a new app

1. Start off by going `Droptop settings >> Community apps >> Create new app`
2. A window will open. Select between "Droptop app" or "WebView app".&#x20;
   1. A "Droptop app" is for creating an app using Rainmeter code, and can either be a simple button in the bar that launches a shortcut, or expands into a dropdown menu with various options when clicked.
   2. A "WebView app" is for displaying a website of your choice in a dropdown menu.
3. Choose a name for your app and the author's name, pressing `Enter` to confirm your entry
4. Select `Choose an icon for your app`. Select a .png image of your choice, preferably 32x32 pixels. This icon is what will appear in the bar. You can find icons for your app at flaticon.com, or you can make your own.
5. If "Droptop app" was selected, two options are available; "App has a dropdown menu" or "App is just a button". Select an option based on the type of app you want to make.
6. Use the option "Use full color icon" if you want the icon in the bar to always be the same color as the image uploaded - Otherwise, the color of the icon will follow the user's current theme and color settings.
7. Select `Generate app`when ready.

## Editing your new app

1. Your new app will now appear in the bar. If you selected "WebView app" or "Droptop app" with "App has a dropdown menu" enabled, clicking on the app icon will open your app.
2. Right-click twice (Double right-click) anywhere inside of your app to open a quick navigation box. Here you can access the essential files and folders that make-up your app. Select `Edit skin (Custom app.ini)`
3. The code for your app's main dropdown menu will appear.

## Understanding the basics

If you haven't already, refer to the Rainmeter Documentation ([https://docs.rainmeter.net/](https://docs.rainmeter.net/)) to familiarize yourself with concepts such as Bangs, Sections, Variables, and other essential parts of how Rainmeter works.&#x20;

If another Droptop Community App has a similar feature or special function that you would like to include in your app, you can edit that app and see exactly how it was implemented. Use that knowledge to learn and assist in adding that feature to your app.
