# BarModifier Files

## Making special changes to your app's icon

By default, your app is designed to open a dropdown menu containing your app, but depending on how you want your app to work, you might not want a dropdown menu to appear when clicking its button and instead open a shortcut, or a URL, or simply display some kind of information and not be clickable at all.

BarModifier will allow you to make modification to the code of the top bar, including the button of your app and how it behaves. In your app folder, you will have a folder called BarModifier. Inside, you will find `BarModifier1.ini` to `BarModifier5.ini`. These files represent the 5 slots your app may be in. Generally speaking, you would want all 5 of these files to contain exactly the same content, with the exception of the section name at the top, \[CustomApp1] to \[CustomApp5], which will need to match the BarModifier file number 1 to 5.

To make more advanced changes to BarModifier, it's recommended you take a look at some other apps other users have already made, copy & replace the BarModifier files in your app, and make any adjustments you choose from there. This will save you time and energy. The Community App `Quick Settings - Cariboudjan` for example, is a simple icon that toggles Quick Settings. It does not have a dropdown menu. More complicated skins like `Shortcut - Phan` have multiple buttons and no dropdown menu.
