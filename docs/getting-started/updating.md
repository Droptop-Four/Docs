## Automatic detection

Droptop Four can automatically detect when it's available a new update and it'll show the update app on the right side of the bar.

{% hint style="info" %}
The app gives you the possibility to update also Community Apps
{% endhint %}

If you click on the `Update Droptop to #.###.#` button, then `Download update now`, the download of the `Droptop Update.rmskin` file will start in a browser window.

After the download is finished, you can install the update.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the Rainmeter Skin Installer raises the error: _"Unable to move: path"_, try to log out of your user, log back in, and try the installation again.

If the error persists, please let us know.
{% endhint %}

## Hiding the update notification

In the update app there is an option to remove the notifications when a new version is available.

We advise to keep that active, but if you want to remove it, if you want to update Droptop you'll need to download the update version on the [website](https://www.droptopfour.com/update/) or using the Discord bot on our [Discord Server](https://droptopfour.com/discord).&#x20;
