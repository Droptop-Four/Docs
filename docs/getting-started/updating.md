If you receive the error _"Unable to move to: \[path]"_: Log out of your PC and log back in. Try the update again.

If the error persists, please let us know.

## Hiding the update notification

Press the "Dismiss update notification" to remove the green notification icon until the next update is available, or the next time you restart your PC.

Select "Don't notify me" to never show the green notification icon again. To manually check for updates, go to `Droptop settings >> Support >> Check online for an update` or you can check for updates on our [Discord Server](https://droptopfour.com/discord) #Annoucements channel.
