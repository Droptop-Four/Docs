# Color & opacity

To personalize your Droptop Four bar you can change its colors and opacity of every component. Just head to `Droptop settings >> Color & opacity` and start changing the colors to the ones you like.

In every color setting you'll find 3 sliders to adjust the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values and one slider to adjust the opacity of the color you chose.
