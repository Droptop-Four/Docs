# Showing mode

In `Droptop settings >> Options >> Change mode` you can change how droptop is shown and can be accessed.

## Always show

By choosing `Droptop settings >> Options >> Change mode >> Always show Droptop`, droptop will be always accessible on the top of your screen. All your windows won't overlap the bar as the usable desktop area is modified to reserve a top space only for droptop.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If windows starts to overlap or underlap the bar, right click on the bar and click `Refresh Droptop`.\
\
In rare instances, you may need to force close Explorer.exe, reopen Explorer.exe, and Refresh Droptop. Or restart your PC. This may be caused by updating or restarting GPU Drivers.
{% endhint %}

## Autohide

By choosing `Droptop settings >> Options >> Change mode >> Autohide when not in use`, droptop will automatically hide out of your sight, and when you place your cursor on the top pixel of your screen it'll show again.&#x20;

### Reveal delay

You can set the time after which droptop should appear in `Droptop settings >> Options >> Autohide settings >> Set autohide reveal delay`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's possible you have to leave your mouse on the top pixel for a couple of seconds to make droptop appear also if you selected the delay to be none.
{% endhint %}

### Fade speed

You can set the speed of the fade in/out of droptop in `Droptop settings >> Options >> Autohide settings >> Set autohide fade speed`.

## Hide menu bar

The `Droptop settings >> Options >> More options >> Hide menu bar` button will temporarily hide droptop until the cursor will touch the top pixel of the screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
The option is also present in the right click menu of the bar
{% endhint %}

## Change size

You can adjust the size of the bar by changing between the options in `Droptop settings >> Options >> Adjust size setting`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The option is also present in the right click menu of the bar
{% endhint %}
