## Use `.ahk` instead of `.exe`

If you have [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed, and want to troubleshoot something in the `ahk` files, you can use this option to force droptop to use the not compiled `ahk` files instead of precompiled `exe`s.

Toggle at `Droptop settings >> Options >> Advanced >> Use .ahk instead of .exe`.

## Backlight compatibility mode

If the droptop brightness slider of your monitor doesn't work, you can see if enabling the `Droptop settings >> Options >> Advanced >> Backlight compatibility mode` can help.

## Disable DPI scaling

If you have problems with scaling between droptop and other Rainmeter skins, try to toggle the `Droptop settings >> Options >> Advanced >> Disable DPI scaling (Restart required)` option.

## Touchscreen mode

`Droptop settings >> Options >> Advanced >> Touchscreen mode` allows an easier navigation when using fingers as input instead of a mouse cursor.

## Disable hover actions
