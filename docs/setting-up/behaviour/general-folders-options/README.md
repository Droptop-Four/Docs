description: Droptop Four folder options

# General folders options

## Middle click behaviour

You can chose the action to perform when middle-clicking on an item of a folder. Go to `Droptop settings >> Options >> Menu options >> Middle-clicking on folder items...` and change the selected option.

You can choose between:

* Open file or folder
* Open file or folder properties
* Do nothing

## Show start button

If you want to show on the droptop bar a button to show the Windows Start menu, you can enable the option by right clicking on any folder you have enabled on the bar and toggle the `Show Start button` option.

By clicking the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/WinHome.png) button, the Windows Start menu will appear

## Show application menu

If you want to display on droptop the name of your currently focused app, you have to have enabled the `Show application menu` option.&#x20;

When you click on the name of the application, you'll find a list of actions you can perform, and if you have them, you'll find also the application commands you created for that app.

## Add shortcut to a folder

If you want to add an app to a droptop folder, open the app, click on the app name and select the `Add shortcut to` button, then select the folder you want to have the shortcut in, and you're done!&#x20;

Else you can drag & drop files and folders opening the `Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Droptop Folders` directory, choosing the folder you want to add what you want to, and refreshing droptop.
